                Hi I am Nick.<br>
    
                I am applying to get OAuth 2.0 credentials for Youtube API V3.<br>
                
                Specifically I am looking to get my YouTube videos watch time and my watch video history list from the YouTube api.<br?>
                
                I am the creator of what sticks. A website aimed at analyzing personal data to help determine what impacts sleep.<br>
                
                Here is a view of my user dashboard. It has my sleep data which Iâ€™ve collect from the Oura Ring API and weather data from another API. I would like to add the YouTube data I just mentioned.
                <br>
                
                And I would like to allow users, who would like to join, to add their YouTube data as well.<br>
